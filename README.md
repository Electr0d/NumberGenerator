## Use case

There are many use cases for this program, this is one I use personally:

When practicing textbook questions, I set the minimum value to 1, maximum value to the final question and frequency value to how many questions I want to do, then generate.
I would highlight the question I am doing so that I keep track. When I am done, I highlight the next row.
